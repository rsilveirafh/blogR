## What this post is about?

- `ggplot2` tips


## History

Some time ago, lost through the deep arms of the internet ðŸ˜Ž, I have found a great drawing with all the theme elements references of a plot within `ggplot2`.

But, as is well known, if you don't save that, it will be lost forever.

Except when you have a great community on [twitter](http://twitter.com/), and there is a bunch of good people trying to help everyone!

*Some time ahead...*

I finally found it! Here it is:


```{r}
#| label: fig-ggplot
#| fig-cap: ggplot2 theme elements references, by Isabella Benabaye.
#| echo: false

knitr::include_graphics("https://isabella-b.com/blog/ggplot2-theme-elements-reference/ggplot2-theme-elements-reference-v2_hu8994090e1960a0a71878a3756da20076_580819_2000x2000_fit_lanczos_2.png")
```


I also found the [post](https://isabella-b.com/blog/ggplot2-theme-elements-reference/) on her blog, with better quality [images](https://isabella-b.com/files/ggplot2-theme-elements-reference-v2.png) and/or a [pdf](https://isabella-b.com/files/ggplot2-theme-elements-reference-v2.pdf) file.


## The history continues...

More interesting: actually, she had her idea after this twitter post from Henry Wang:

```{r}
#| label: fig-tweet
#| fig-cap: Henry Wang's tweet.
#| echo: false
#| out-width: 70%

tweetrmd::tweet_screenshot("https://twitter.com/henrywangnl/status/1259396196713537536?s=20&t=VdkteE_5Vjc676_nAF8kew")

```


And, he also made a nice [post](https://henrywang.nl/ggplot2-theme-elements-demonstration/) about the subject (where you can download his version of `ggplot2` theme elements demonstration).


## Finishing

That's it, enjoy the creativity and good ideas from all these people, soon I'll bring some more.

Thanks for the reading, cheers!

R.
