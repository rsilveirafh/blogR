In Brazil we are about to choose the next President for the 4 years ahead.

I am a workers party supporter (PT, *Partido dos Trabalhadores*), with **Lula** as our candidate.

With this being told, the PT flag is a white star in a red background, my plan is to draw this, showing all the steps to do it.


First of all, we will need to load `ggplot2`, the package that we will use in this session:

```{r}
#| echo: true

library(ggplot2)

```
