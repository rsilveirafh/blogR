## What this post is about?

- Drawing a star using `ggplot2` in R Language.


## History:

In Brazil we are about to choose the next President for the 4 years ahead.

I am a workers party supporter (PT, *Partido dos Trabalhadores*), with **[Lula](https://twitter.com/LulaOficial)** as our candidate.

```{r}
#| label: fig-lula
#| fig-cap: Lulinha peace and love <3
#| echo: false

knitr::include_graphics("lula.jpeg")

```

With this being told, the PT flag is a white star in a red background, my plan is to draw this, showing all the steps to do it.


## Hands on!

First of all, we will need to load `dplyr` and `ggplot2`, the package of functions that we will use in this session:

```{r}
#| label: packages

library(dplyr) # data wrangling
library(ggplot2) # plots

```

Let's start by creating our blank canvas:

```{r}
#| label: plot01
#| fig-cap: Blank canvas.

ggplot()

```

Now we can ask to ggplot to put a void theme (without texts or axis), and then to add a red background:

```{r}
#| label: plot02
#| fig-cap: Red canvas.

red <- ggplot() +
	theme_void() +
	theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = "red"))

red

```

The challenge now is to draw by draft our star. First, let's study how it is:

```{r}
#| label: fig-star
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: A star and its coordinates.
#| out-width: 150%

knitr::include_graphics("star.jpg")

```

To do this, let's create a `tibble` with the `x` and `y` coordinates (11 to close the polygon):

```{r}
#| label: data-star
#| fig-cap: Star coordinates.

r <- rep_len(x = c(100, 100 * sin(pi/10) / cos(pi/5)), 
			 length.out = 11)

star <- tibble(coord = 1:11,
			   x = r * sin(seq(0, 2 * pi, length.out = 11)),
			   y = r * cos(seq(0, 2 * pi, length.out = 11)))

knitr::kable(star, align = "c")

```

Now, let's include the star coordinates (and the paths) within the red plot:

```{r}
#| label: plot03
#| fig-cap: Almost there.

red +
	geom_polygon(data = star, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y))

```

The next step is to paint the star in white color, and also fix the coordinates:

```{r}
#| label: plot04
#| fig-cap: The workers party flag!

pt <- red +
	geom_polygon(data = star, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y),
				 fill = "white") +
	coord_equal()

pt 

```

Our PT flag is ready!

Just to complete, we can include the number of the party in the middle of the star, the number 13!

```{r}
#| label: plot05
#| fig-cap: It is ready!

pt +
	annotate(geom = "text",
			 label = 13,
			 x = -4,
			 y = 0,
			 size = 40,
			 color = "red")
	
```

We have our flag! 


## Finishing

The next step is to dress all red at October 30th 2022, vote in our great eletronic voting machines, and hope for the best!

Make the L!

```{r}
#| label: fig-L
#| fig-cap: Faz o L!
#| echo: false

knitr::include_graphics("L.jpg")

```

Cheers,

R.
