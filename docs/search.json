First, letâ€™s study how it is:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigureÂ 2: A star and its coordinates.\n\n\n\n\nTo do this, letâ€™s create a tibble with the x and y coordinates (11 to close the polygon):\n\nr <- rep_len(x = c(100, 100 * sin(pi/10) / cos(pi/5)), \n             length.out = 11)\n\nstar <- tibble(coord = 1:11,\n               x = r * sin(seq(0, 2 * pi, length.out = 11)),\n               y = r * cos(seq(0, 2 * pi, length.out = 11)))\n\nknitr::kable(star, align = \"c\")\n\n\n\n\ncoord\nx\ny\n\n\n\n\n1\n0.00000\n100.0000\n\n\n2\n22.45140\n30.9017\n\n\n3\n95.10565\n30.9017\n\n\n4\n36.32713\n-11.8034\n\n\n5\n58.77853\n-80.9017\n\n\n6\n0.00000\n-38.1966\n\n\n7\n-58.77853\n-80.9017\n\n\n8\n-36.32713\n-11.8034\n\n\n9\n-95.10565\n30.9017\n\n\n10\n-22.45140\n30.9017\n\n\n11\n0.00000\n100.0000\n\n\n\nStar coordinates.\n\n\nNow, letâ€™s include the star coordinates (and the paths) within the red plot:\n\nred +\n    geom_polygon(data = star, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y))\n\n\n\n\nAlmost there.\n\n\n\n\nThe next step is to paint the star in white color, and also fix the coordinates:\n\npt <- red +\n    geom_polygon(data = star, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y),\n                 fill = \"white\") +\n    coord_equal()\n\npt \n\n\n\n\nThe workers party flag!\n\n\n\n\nOur PT flag is ready!\nJust to complete, we can include the number of the party in the middle of the star, the number 13!\n\npt +\n    annotate(geom = \"text\",\n             label = 13,\n             x = -4,\n             y = 0,\n             size = 40,\n             color = \"red\")\n\n\n\n\nIt is ready!\n\n\n\n\nWe have our flag!"
