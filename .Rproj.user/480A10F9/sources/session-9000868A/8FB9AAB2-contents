In Brazil we are about to choose the next President for the 4 years ahead.

I am a workers party supporter (PT, *Partido dos Trabalhadores*), with **[Lula](https://twitter.com/LulaOficial)** as our candidate.

```{r}
#| label: fig-lula
#| fig-cap: Lulinha peace and love <3
#| echo: false

knitr::include_graphics("lula.jpeg")
```

With this being told, the PT flag is a white star in a red background, my plan is to draw this, showing all the steps to do it.

First of all, we will need to load `ggplot2`, the package that we will use in this session:

```{r p1}

library(ggplot2)

```
